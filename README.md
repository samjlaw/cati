# Cards Against the Internet
This is my Capstone project for Simpson College.
It is an online browser version of Cards Against Humanity, inspired by other online browser games like Kahoot, Jackbox, and Pretend You're Xyzzy.
You can play it with friends (or by yourself...) at cards-against-the-internet.herokuapp.com
