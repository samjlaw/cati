First commit.	

------------------------------------------------------------------
Jan 30, 2020 Update 2:

Added client-server connections. 
	Clients can send any kind of information to server and vice-versa.
	Currently only used for chat.

Added chat. 
	Players can submit messages and view previous chat history for as long as they were connected.
	Currently no usernames, and therefore messages cannot be differentiated between users.

Added buttons for five cards.
	Currently serves no purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Jan 30, 2020 Update 3:

Added basic CSS styling.
	The only element on screen is a small box for chat history and submission.
	This is more of a "proof of concept" for the style of the final game, which is very minimalist.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Jan 31, 2020:

Fixed a typo in server.js that caused a crash.

Feb 13, 2020:

Improvements to chat system.
	Players are now required to enter a name before being allowed to talk or play.
	Names are currently entered via the chat bar. The first message a player sends will set their name.
	Players cannot choose names that already exist, names that contain spaces or are empty, or names that are too long.
	Names are not permanent, they become available again when that player leaves the server.
	Messages are now tagged with player names, therefore messages are no longer anonymous.
	The server will announce when a player has joined (after they set their name), and when they leave.
	
Added basic functionality for white cards.
	Clicking one of the card buttons will send a message in chat that the user has submitted that card.
	Each card has a unique value. Cards are predetermined, and are the same five for everyone.
	Cards are not labelled.

Added canvas.
	Currently sits above chat.
	Canvas is currently blank.
	This is where any potential graphics / animations will be shown.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Feb 28, 2020 Update 1:

Added leaderboard.
	Currently connected players will have their names appear on the leaderboard. 
	Eventually their score will be there too, but not now.
	When a player leaves, their name is removed from the leaderboard.
	The leaderboard also alleviates the issue where players don't know what names are taken, since they are all visible now.
	
Major overhaul to client interface.
	The canvas is now front and center, with the leaderboard on the left, chat on the right, and cards underneath.
	Each entry of chat and leaderboard are now separated by outlines to make it easier to read.
	Interface now scales based on the window resolution. Everything should be visible without having to scroll!
	Cards are now bigger (no longer squished under chat), and are now labelled.

Improvements to cards.
	White cards are now sent to the player from the server, rather than being client-side.
	The server will randomly choose five cards from the list of available cards to give to the player when they first set their name.
	Players can only submit one card at a time. If the player tries to submit any more cards after their first, nothing will happen.
	Currently no system in place for the player to have less than five cards at a time.
	No changes or updates have been made to black cards.

Added some temporary debugging tools in chat to test cards.

The server no longer announces when an unnamed player leaves.

Fixed an oversight where players could have the same name if different letters were capitalized.

Fixed a few typos in CSS style sheet.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Feb 28, 2020 Update 2:

Added changelog.
	Retroactively documented changes from previous updates.

Fixed an issue where players could submit 'null' if they clicked on a blank card. Blank cards currently do nothing.

Minor changes to debug syntax.
