Jan 30, 2020 Update 1:

First commit.	

------------------------------------------------------------------
Jan 30, 2020 Update 2:

Added client-server connections. 
	Clients can send any kind of information to server and vice-versa.
	Currently only used for chat.

Added chat. 
	Players can submit messages and view previous chat history for as long as they were connected.
	Currently no usernames, and therefore messages cannot be differentiated between users.

Added buttons for five cards.
	Currently serves no purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Jan 30, 2020 Update 3:

Added basic CSS styling.
	The only element on screen is a small box for chat history and submission.
	This is more of a "proof of concept" for the style of the final game, which is very minimalist.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Jan 31, 2020:

Fixed a typo in server.js that caused a crash.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Feb 13, 2020:

Improvements to chat system.
	Players are now required to enter a name before being allowed to talk or play.
	Names are currently entered via the chat bar. The first message a player sends will set their name.
	Players cannot choose names that already exist, names that contain spaces or are empty, or names that are too long.
	Names are not permanent, they become available again when that player leaves the server.
	Messages are now tagged with player names, therefore messages are no longer anonymous.
	The server will announce when a player has joined (after they set their name), and when they leave.
	
Added basic functionality for white cards.
	Clicking one of the card buttons will send a message in chat that the user has submitted that card.
	Each card has a unique value. Cards are predetermined, and are the same five for everyone.
	Cards are not labelled.

Added canvas.
	Currently sits above chat.
	Canvas is currently blank.
	This is where any potential graphics / animations will be shown.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Feb 28, 2020 Update 1:

Added leaderboard.
	Currently connected players will have their names appear on the leaderboard. 
	Eventually their score will be there too, but not now.
	When a player leaves, their name is removed from the leaderboard.
	The leaderboard also alleviates the issue where players don't know what names are taken, since they are all visible now.
	
Major overhaul to client interface.
	The canvas is now front and center, with the leaderboard on the left, chat on the right, and cards underneath.
	Each entry of chat and leaderboard are now separated by outlines to make it easier to read.
	Interface now scales based on the window resolution. Everything should be visible without having to scroll!
	Cards are now bigger (no longer squished under chat), and are now labelled.

Improvements to cards.
	White cards are now sent to the player from the server, rather than being client-side.
	The server will randomly choose five cards from the list of available cards to give to the player when they first set their name.
	Players can only submit one card at a time. If the player tries to submit any more cards after their first, nothing will happen.
	Currently no system in place for the player to have less than five cards at a time.
	No changes or updates have been made to black cards.

Added some temporary debugging tools in chat to test cards.

The server no longer announces when an unnamed player leaves.

Fixed an oversight where players could have the same name if different letters were capitalized.

Fixed a few typos in CSS style sheet.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Feb 28, 2020 Update 2:

Added changelog.
	Retroactively documented changes from previous updates.

Fixed an issue where players could submit 'null' if they clicked on a blank card. Blank cards currently do nothing.

Minor changes to debug syntax.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Mar 31, 2020:

Added partial support for rooms.
	Chat messages are only sent to players in the same room.
	Players in other rooms currently still show up on the leaderboard, and players currently cannot have the same name as another player in a different room.
	
Began work on canvas graphics.
	Currently there is one black card with one prompt that serves as a template for how it may look in the future.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------
Apr 5, 2020:

Improvements to canvas graphics.
	The middle card (and text) now resizes with resolution scaling, and stays within the boundaries of the canvas.
	Currently does not keep the same dimensions if the aspect ratio changes.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------
Apr 12, 2020:

Improvements to room support.
	The room code must now be a 4 digit alphanumerical code, and cannot have spaces.
	The room code is displayed at the top of the leaderboard, so players can more easily share with their friends.
	Players are allowed to create their own room codes. If they enter a new code, they are the room creator and will be granted special permissions, otherwise they will just join an existing room.
	The leaderboard now only displays players in the same room. Additionally, players can pick a unique name in their room, even if it is taken in a different room.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------
Apr 13, 2020:

Fixed an oversight where all rooms shared the same deck of cards, and therefore all rooms ran out of cards very quickly. Card decks are now per-room.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Apr 22, 2020:

Added asynchronous gameplay aspects.
	When the room is created, a queue for judges is created. Players are placed in the queue in the order they join the room.
	Each round will have one judge. Every other player will submit their card to the judge, and the judge will pick their favorite. Whoever submitted the favorite will get a point for that round.
	There is currently only support for one round at a time. Although the judge for the next round is correctly assigned, they just can't do anything yet.
	The judge's name is displayed on the client's canvas, and is affected by resolution scaling similarly to the black card.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------
Apr 23, 2020:

Players can no longer join rooms with games in progress.

Rooms can now only have a maximum of six total players.

Cards that go unused by players when they leave the room are now added back to the room's deck for other players to use.

Fixed an issue where players would receive extra blank cards if they have fewer than five options. This also goes for judges choosing their favorite response.
	A previous update removed the functionality of these unintentional blank cards as a temporary measure, but now they don't show up at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Apr 24, 2020:

Fixed an issue that caused a server crash when a player with no deck would leave their room.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Apr 25, 2020:

Added support for multiple rounds.
	As soon as the judge picks their card for the round, the next judge is selected, and a new round begins with the same rules as before, but with a new judge.
	All players are given a normal deck when joining, but they aren't able to see it when they are the selected to be the judge.
	When the next judge is selected, the player's deck is given back to them.
	Judges still abide by the queue system established in a previous update. When the last connected player ends their round as the judge, the host becomes the judge again, and so on.

Players are now given new cards as soon as they submit their card for the round.
	If there are no more cards able to be given, then the button is simply removed from the client view.
	
Added support for win conditions.
	At a specified time or condition, the game can declare the final winner based on who has the most points.
	Currently the only conditions to end a game are when there are no more black cards left to play, or when too many players leave and the game cannot continue.
	
The host can no longer start a game with less than 3 players. If players leave mid-game and there are fewer than 3 players at the start of a round, the game will end immediately.

Fixed an issue that caused a server crash when a room would become empty after two or more players leave simultaneously. 

Fixed an issue that caused a server crash when the game attempted to pick a player that previously left the room as the next judge.
